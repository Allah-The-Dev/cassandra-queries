- When ever a write request comes in, cassandra node will put data in 2 places:
    - Memtable (RAM), it maintains data order based on clustering columns
    - Commit log (Disk), it do not maintains any data order
    - If RAM gets wiped out, commit log will re-create it

- Once all writes are done, Memtable will flush data to SS table in Disk    
    - and Memtable and Disk commit logs will be wiped out

- Optmized Write path for spinning Disk
    - Keep 2 separate Disk
    - one for commit logs, which will continiously seek new data
    - while second disk will just maintains the SS tables

- Optimized write path for SSD
    - both commit logs and SS tables are maintained in same disk
    - SS tables are immutable, hence more and more no of SS tables keeps getting created
    - and using compaction techniques, SS tables data gets merged to smaller no of SS tables
