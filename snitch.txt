Coordinator node - Node which gets client request, and coordinate with other nodes to get the info

Snitch - snitch is responsible for understanding the topology of our cluster
    - snitch keeps track of in which data center on which rack a particular node is
    - snitch main job is to decide which node will be most responsible for a particular request

Types of snitch
    - Simple snitch:
        - default snitch, it assumes that cluster have only a single node
    - Property file snitch  
        - every node maintains DC and rack info all other nodes
    - Gossiping property file snitch    
        - every node maintains info about only it's location of DC and rack
        - cassandra then spreads this info to all other nodes using gossip protocol
    - Dynamic snitch
        - purpose of this is to monitor the performance of all other nodes
        - this is turned on by default
        - for maintaining consistency of data it uses checksum value against data received from other nodes
