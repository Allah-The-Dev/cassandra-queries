- Reads data from memtable and SS tables and matches the timestamp of those data    
    - and return the latest one, and in most cases memtable have the latest data

- If memtable do not have data (byte address in memory of partition is used for this purpose)
    - then it uses caching technique
    - for caching it uses multiple phases of checks
        - Bloom filter - this will tell if this SS table at all contains asked partition key
        - Key cache - it'll maintain byte address of most frequently accessed partition keys
        - Partition summary - when partition index grows to very large, it'll group those indexes to make it shorter
        - Partiton index - it maintains byte address of partition keys
        - SS table - this is the acutal data representation present in Disk

- Row caching is disabled by default
- Key and counter caching is enabled by default
