Gossip protocol:
    - nodes communicate with some of the cluster nodes, and share info

Gossip protocol communication includes:
    - Heartbeat state
        - when the node started
        - Timestamp: at what time this info was updated
    - Application state: 
        - status of node: Normal/Leaving/Joining
        - DC
        - Rack
        - Schema
        - Load: disk pressure
        - Severity: I/O pressure

How Gossip protocol works:
    - One node send info about other nodes to it's peer nodes, which includes:
        - Node's ip (of which info it have)
        - Heartbeat
        - Application state
    - Second node compares it's info against info sent by first node, and if it sees that some of my 
        - info is latest, 
        - then it'll send the udpated info to node 1
        - once node 1 update it's info/metadata it'll acknowledge that to node 2
